### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<tr>
    <td>calories</td>
     <td class="cal">277Kcal</td>
</tr>
```
```css

li::marker{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}

@media screen and (max-width:1000px) {

    body{
        margin:0px;
    }
    .main{
        
        width:100%;
    }
    
}
```

### Continued development

I have figured out that i new to learn how to work with vh & vw and not just pixels and percentages. i would also love to develop myself in making html work responsive with less code.
