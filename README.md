## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Tables

### What I learned

Use this section to recap some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<tr>
    <td>calories</td>
     <td class="cal">277Kcal</td>
</tr>
```
```css

li::marker{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}

@media screen and (max-width:1000px) {

    body{
        margin:0px;
    }
    .main{
        
        width:100%;
    }
    
}
```

### Continued development

I have figured out that I need to learn how to work with vh & vw and not just pixels and percentages. I would also love to develop myself in making HTML work responsive with less code.

I would like to thank my friend Zulaihat Salihu who helped me with the task of adding media Querry to my CSS code to make it responsive to different screen sizes.
